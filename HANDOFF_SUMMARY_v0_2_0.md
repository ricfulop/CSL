## CSL Fusion Backend – Handoff Summary (v0.2.0)

### Executive overview
- Shipped v0.2.0 with major Fusion backend upgrades, APS hardening, expanded conformance tooling, and documentation updates.
- Ready for v0.3.0: focus on stable IDs hardening, CI golden tests, constraints/patterns/export parity, and capability publishing.

### Key changes completed in this session
- Fusion backend
  - Materials/PMI enhancements; added `by_material` query filter.
  - APS: token cache/refresh, retries/backoff, telemetry, default bucket.
  - Loft: supports requested G2 continuity (diag if unsupported) and rails/centerline; optional sections_continuity.
  - Fillet/Chamfer: tangent-chain; distance+angle and two-distance variants; variable groups preserved.
  - Draft: neutral plane by query/name; explicit pull_dir handling.
  - Wrap/Emboss/Project: along-direction parsing; depth/angle/engrave; improved diagnostics.
  - Threads: face queries; designation/class/handedness; optional length when supported.
  - Holes: plane selection; through_all/depth distance; optional callout diagnostic.
  - Patterns: per-instance table (dx/dy/dz, angle+axis, per-row count) via move/copy fallback.
  - Joints: cylindrical/planar/ball/pin-slot when available; limits applied; diagnostics for damping/preload.
  - Queries/IDs: lineage persisted; additional predicates wired; best-effort stable IDs.

- Conformance/tests
  - Conformance harness expanded with cases (loft G1/G2+rail, variable fillet/chamfer, emboss, joints).
  - Outputs `out/conformance_report.json` and CI-friendly `out/golden_summary.json`.
  - Export units parity script for STL/STEP tessellation/units.

- Docs/schema
  - Added `FUSION_FEATURE_COVERAGE.md` checklist.
  - Updated `CSL_v1_2_proposal.md` (loft rails/sections_continuity; fillet tangent_chain; chamfer angle/d2; constraints/patterns additions).
  - Introduced v1.2 draft fields in `CSL_v1_1/csl_v1_1_schema.json` (non-breaking, optional).
  - README updates for harness and export-units test.

### Release
- Tag: `v0.2.0` (pushed)
- Changelog: `CHANGELOG.md`

### Next milestone (v0.3.0, 2–3 weeks)
- Stable IDs hardening: reopen/regeneration reconciliation; E12xx repair guidance.
- Conformance & CI: goldens for loft G2/orientation, variable fillet/chamfer, wrap direction, advanced joints, selection determinism; CI gate on golden_summary.json.
- APS next: optional Design Automation shim; structured telemetry; env docs.
- Constraints expansion: curvature continuity (diag fallback), construction/driven toggles.
- Patterns parity: native per-instance when supported; keep fallback.
- Export parity: round-trip unit verification; tighten STL tessellation bounds.
- Capability publishing: granular capability JSON (variable fillet/chamfer, G2 loft, emboss direction, joint types).
- Docs/examples: new examples and coverage matrix updates.

### Toward 100% engineering-grade
- Feature depth: sheet metal, surface ops, full PMI/GD&T, complete constraint set.
- Determinism: stable IDs proven across edit/reorder/suppress/regenerate; multi-version Fusion tests.
- Assemblies: damping/preload where supported, remaining joint options, assembly patterns, mate connectors.
- Selections: full predicate set with combinators and tolerances; negative/edge-case tests.
- Exports: STEP/3MF parity; optional AP242 metadata.
- APS/automation: DA compatibility, resumable uploads, error taxonomy, CI telemetry.
- Reliability/QA: performance baselines, fuzzing for queries/IR, leak checks.
- Packaging/DX/Security: add-in installer, example gallery, capability JSON publish, pinned deps, CI policy checks.
