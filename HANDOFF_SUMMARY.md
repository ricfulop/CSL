## CSL Fusion Backend – Handoff Summary (v1.1)

### Context
This session focused on bringing the Fusion 360 backend toward production-grade completeness for CSL v1.1, updating docs, creating tracking issues, and wiring APS integration. Most core functionality is implemented; a few items remain to reach 100% engineering-grade fidelity.

### What’s implemented (high level)
- Sketch: spline/NURBS, ellipse/elliptical arc, text; constraints and dimensions.
- Features:
  - Thin extrude (thin wall with side), rib (path, thickness, draft)
  - Fillet/chamfer: per-edge groups; variable radius/distance and setbacks (when API supports); diagnostics otherwise
  - Draft: face-set targeting via queries
  - Holes: taper, drill angle, counterbore/countersink; query-driven placement
  - Threads: designation/class/handedness; cosmetic/modeled
  - Move/offset/replace face; split by face/profile
  - Patterns: grid + path; table-driven fallback via move/copy; robust seed selection
  - Boolean: multi-tool, keep-tools variants
  - Sweep: orientation hint; guide rail support where available
  - Loft: guide rails; “no fallback” enforcement for requested continuity/orientation with diagnostics if unsupported
  - Wrap/Emboss: native EmbossFeatures with source sketch + face targets; depth/angle/engrave options
- Selection/Queries: lineage tracking; created_by/owner_feature==, pattern_instances, tangent_connected(tol), largest_by, curvature≈/radius≈/area≈ with tol, by_material; attribute tags for cross-session stability
- Diagnostics/Capabilities: E-codes and capability publishing
- Export/Thumbnail: STL mesh refinement, units (best-effort), binary/text, deviation/max edge/aspect ratio; deterministic thumbnail view/style/background
- Assemblies/Joints: revolute/slider/rigid, axis selection, min/max limits; diagnostics for damping/preload
- APS Integration: token, bucket ensure, uploads; orchestrate(plan) helper
- Docs: backlog converted to Completed vs Remaining with links; gap analysis refreshed; query determinism/tolerances documented

### Urgent fix (open linter errors)
There is a malformed try/except block in `triple_lindy/transpilers/fusion360_backend.py` inside `_apply_materials_and_pmi`. Fix by replacing that method with a simple, lint-safe version.

Suggested replacement for `_apply_materials_and_pmi` (single try/except):

```python
def _apply_materials_and_pmi(self, csl_ir: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    try:
        import adsk.core  # type: ignore
        import adsk.fusion  # type: ignore
        app, ui, design = self._ensure_design()
        root_comp = design.rootComponent
        # Apply appearances by name (simple path)
        mats = csl_ir.get("materials") or []
        if isinstance(mats, list):
            for m in mats:
                if not isinstance(m, dict):
                    continue
                ap = m.get("appearance") or m.get("color")
                if not ap:
                    continue
                found = None
                for i in range(app.appearanceLibraries.count):
                    try:
                        lib = app.appearanceLibraries.item(i)
                        obj = lib.appearances.itemByName(str(ap))
                        if obj:
                            found = obj
                            break
                    except Exception:
                        continue
                if found:
                    try:
                        for b in root_comp.bRepBodies:
                            b.appearance = found
                    except Exception:
                        pass
        # PMI notes on XY plane
        pmi_list = csl_ir.get("pmi") or []
        if isinstance(pmi_list, list) and len(pmi_list) > 0:
            sk = root_comp.sketches.add(root_comp.xYConstructionPlane)
            for note in pmi_list:
                if not isinstance(note, dict) or not note.get("note"):
                    continue
                try:
                    h_mm = self._parse_length_mm(note.get("height") or "5") or 5.0
                    ti = sk.sketchTexts.createInput(str(note.get("note")), h_mm/10.0)
                    p = adsk.core.Point3D.create(0, 0, 0)
                    ti.setAsMultiLine(p, 0.0, adsk.core.HorizontalAlignments.LeftHorizontalAlignment,
                                      adsk.core.VerticalAlignments.TopVerticalAlignment, 0.0)
                    sk.sketchTexts.add(ti)
                except Exception:
                    pass
    except Exception:
        pass
```

### Remaining production-grade items
- prod-grade-gap-docs (in_progress):
  - Tighten gap analysis to reflect current status; add acceptance matrices per feature
- prod-grade-materials-pmi (in_progress):
  - Materials: library refs, density/appearance overrides (where API supports); PMI placement on faces/planes with rotation and sizing
- prod-grade-aps-orchestration (pending):
  - Retries with backoff, token refresh, telemetry (duration/status), configurable buckets/paths
- prod-grade-conformance (pending):
  - Add golden tests and perf checks for features/queries (loft continuity, variable fillet/chamfer, wrap/emboss, joints limits)

### Tracking issues (GitHub)
- #1 Loft/Sweep fidelity: continuity/orientation
- #2 Fillet/Chamfer transitions/setbacks
- #3 Native wrap/emboss
- #4 Patterns table-driven
- #5 Selection/Queries expansion + stable-ID reconciliation
- #6 APS orchestration strategy

### Quick resume checklist for a new session
1) See `HANDOFF_SUMMARY_v0_3_0.md` for the latest shipped scope and next-milestone items
2) Run `make golden-check` locally or in CI to validate changes
3) For APS testing, set `APS_CLIENT_ID`/`APS_CLIENT_SECRET` and try `make aps-auth` and `make aps-da-list-engines`
4) Update `BACKEND_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` acceptance tables as features land
