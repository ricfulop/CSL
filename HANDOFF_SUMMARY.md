## CSL Fusion Backend – Handoff Summary (v1.1)

### Context
This session focused on bringing the Fusion 360 backend toward production-grade completeness for CSL v1.1, updating docs, creating tracking issues, and wiring APS integration. Most core functionality is implemented; a few items remain to reach 100% engineering-grade fidelity.

### What’s implemented (high level)
- Sketch: spline/NURBS, ellipse/elliptical arc, text; constraints and dimensions.
- Features:
  - Thin extrude (thin wall with side), rib (path, thickness, draft)
  - Fillet/chamfer: per-edge groups; variable radius/distance and setbacks (when API supports); diagnostics otherwise
  - Draft: face-set targeting via queries
  - Holes: taper, drill angle, counterbore/countersink; query-driven placement
  - Threads: designation/class/handedness; cosmetic/modeled
  - Move/offset/replace face; split by face/profile
  - Patterns: grid + path; table-driven fallback via move/copy; robust seed selection
  - Boolean: multi-tool, keep-tools variants
  - Sweep: orientation hint; guide rail support where available
  - Loft: guide rails; “no fallback” enforcement for requested continuity/orientation with diagnostics if unsupported
  - Wrap/Emboss: native EmbossFeatures with source sketch + face targets; depth/angle/engrave options
- Selection/Queries: lineage tracking; created_by/owner_feature==, pattern_instances, tangent_connected(tol), largest_by, curvature≈/radius≈/area≈ with tol, by_material; attribute tags for cross-session stability
- Diagnostics/Capabilities: E-codes and capability publishing
- Export/Thumbnail: STL mesh refinement, units (best-effort), binary/text, deviation/max edge/aspect ratio; deterministic thumbnail view/style/background
- Assemblies/Joints: revolute/slider/rigid, axis selection, min/max limits; diagnostics for damping/preload
- APS Integration: token, bucket ensure, uploads; orchestrate(plan) helper
- Docs: backlog converted to Completed vs Remaining with links; gap analysis refreshed; query determinism/tolerances documented

### Recent updates (toward v0.4.0)
- Selection determinism: sorted-token lineage, persisted normalization, and deterministic face ordering; new determinism goldens.
- Surface ops: patch/extend/trim/knit stubs (best-effort where API supports); added conformance case.
- Export: STEP AP242 sidecar metadata JSON emitted alongside `.step` files.
- PMI/GD&T: minimal feature-control-frame placement via PMI text.
- Assemblies: mate connectors and assembly patterns stubs.
- Capabilities/Docs/Make: `make caps` added; README and coverage updated.

### Remaining production-grade items
- prod-grade-gap-docs (in_progress):
  - Tighten gap analysis to reflect current status; add acceptance matrices per feature
- prod-grade-materials-pmi (in_progress):
  - Materials: library refs, density/appearance overrides (where API supports); PMI placement on faces/planes with rotation and sizing
- prod-grade-aps-orchestration (pending):
  - Retries with backoff, token refresh, telemetry (duration/status), configurable buckets/paths
- prod-grade-conformance (pending):
  - Add golden tests and perf checks for features/queries (loft continuity, variable fillet/chamfer, wrap/emboss, joints limits)

### Tracking issues (GitHub)
- #1 Loft/Sweep fidelity: continuity/orientation
- #2 Fillet/Chamfer transitions/setbacks
- #3 Native wrap/emboss
- #4 Patterns table-driven
- #5 Selection/Queries expansion + stable-ID reconciliation
- #6 APS orchestration strategy

### Quick resume checklist for a new session
1) See `HANDOFF_SUMMARY_v0_3_0.md` for the latest shipped scope and next-milestone items
2) Run `make golden-check` locally or in CI to validate changes
3) For APS testing, set `APS_CLIENT_ID`/`APS_CLIENT_SECRET` and try `make aps-auth` and `make aps-da-list-engines`
4) Update `BACKEND_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` acceptance tables as features land
