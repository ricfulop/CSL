You are seeing this because the administrator of this website has set up
Anubis to protect the server against the scourge of AI companies aggressively
scraping websites. This can and does cause downtime for the websites, which
makes their resources inaccessible for everyone.

Anubis is a compromise. Anubis uses a Proof-of-Work scheme in the vein of
Hashcash, a proposed proof-of-work scheme for reducing email spam. The idea is
that at individual scales the additional load is ignorable, but at mass
scraper levels it adds up and makes scraping much more expensive.

Ultimately, this is a placeholder solution so that more time can be spent on
fingerprinting and identifying headless browsers (EG: via how they do font
rendering) so that the challenge proof of work page doesn't need to be
presented to users that are much more likely to be legitimate.

Please note that Anubis requires the use of modern JavaScript features that
plugins like JShelter will disable. Please disable JShelter or other such
plugins for this domain.

Sadly, you must enable JavaScript to get past this challenge. This is required
because AI companies have changed the social contract around how website
hosting works. A no-JS solution is a work-in-progress.
