|  KiCad stable releases occur periodically per the [KiCad Stable Release
Policy](https://dev-docs.kicad.org/en/rules-guidelines/release-policy/). New
features are continually being added to the development branch. If you would
like to take advantage of these new features and help out by testing them,
please download the latest nightly build package for your platform. Nightly
builds may introduce bugs such as file corruption, generation of bad Gerbers,
etc., but it is the goal of the KiCad Development Team to keep the development
branch as usable as possible during new feature development.
