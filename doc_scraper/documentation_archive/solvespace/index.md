# SolveSpace Documentation¶

SolveSpace is a parametric 3D CAD program.

Applications include:

  * **modeling 3d parts** – draw with extrudes, revolves, and Boolean (union/difference) operations
  * **modeling 2d parts** – draw the part as a single section, and export DXF, PDF, SVG; use 3d assembly to verify fit
  * **3d-printed parts** – export the STL or other triangle mesh expected by most 3d printers
  * **preparing CAM data** – export 2d vector art for a waterjet machine or laser cutter; or generate STEP or STL, for import into third-party CAM software for machining
  * **mechanism design** – use the constraint solver to simulate planar or spatial linkages, with pin, ball, or slide joints
  * **plane and solid geometry** – replace hand-solved trigonometry and spreadsheets with a live dimensioned drawing
