## Detailed Description

Basic structures used by other FreeCAD components.

The [Base](../../db/d07/namespaceBase.html "Basic structures used by other
FreeCAD components \(C++ API\)") module includes most of the basic functions
of FreeCAD, such as:

  * Console services: printing different kinds of messages to the FreeCAD report view or the terminal
  * Python interpreter: handles the execution of Python code in FreeCAD
  * Parameter handling: Management, saving and restoring of user preferences settings
  * Units: Management and conversion of different units
