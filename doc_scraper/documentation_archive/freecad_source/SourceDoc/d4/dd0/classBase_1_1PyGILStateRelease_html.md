Base::PyGILStateRelease Class Reference

If a thread holds the global interpreter lock (GIL) but runs a long operation
in C where it doesn't need to hold the GIL it can release it temporarily.

## Detailed Description

If a thread holds the global interpreter lock (GIL) but runs a long operation
in C where it doesn't need to hold the GIL it can release it temporarily.

Or if the thread has to run code in the main thread where Python code may be
executed it must release the GIL to avoid a deadlock. In either case the
thread must hold the GIL when instantiating an object of
[PyGILStateRelease](../../d4/dd0/classBase_1_1PyGILStateRelease.html "If a
thread holds the global interpreter lock \(GIL\) but runs a long operation in
C where it doesn't n..."). As
[PyGILStateLocker](../../db/d27/classBase_1_1PyGILStateLocker.html "If the
application starts we release immediately the global interpreter lock \(GIL\)
once the Python in...") it's best to create an instance of
[PyGILStateRelease](../../d4/dd0/classBase_1_1PyGILStateRelease.html "If a
thread holds the global interpreter lock \(GIL\) but runs a long operation in
C where it doesn't n...") on the stack.
