## Detailed Description

These are the core components of FreeCAD.

It groups the [Base](../../db/d07/namespaceBase.html "Basic structures used by
other FreeCAD components \(C++ API\)") classes, and the main components of
FreeCAD core, spread over their [App](../../dd/dc2/namespaceApp.html "The
FreeCAD Application layer.") and [Gui](../../d9/dad/namespaceGui.html "The
FreeCAD Graphical interface layer.") sides. Core components are programmed in
C++ but provide a broad Python API too. Most of FreeCAD functionality,
however, is defined in Workbenches.
