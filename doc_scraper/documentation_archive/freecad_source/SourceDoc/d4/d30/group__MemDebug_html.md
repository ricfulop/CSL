Memory debugging tools.

Memory debugging tools.

#  Overview

In C++ applications there are a lot of ways to handle memory allocation and
deallocation. As many ways to do it wrong or simply forget to free memory. One
way to overcome this problem is e.g. usage of handle classes (like OpenCASCADE
does) or use a lot of factories. But all of them have drawbacks or performance
penalties. One good way to get memory problems hunted down is the MSCRT Heap
debugging facility. This set of functions opens the possibility to track and
locate all kind of memory problems, e.g. memory leaks.

#  Implementation

The FreeCAD memory debugging is located in the Base::MemDebug class.
