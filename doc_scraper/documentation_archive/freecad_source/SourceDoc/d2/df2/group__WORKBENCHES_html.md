## Detailed Description

Most of FreeCAD's functionality is defined in dedicated Workbenches.

Those plugins, also called **modules** or **workbenches** , provide
functionality for specialized facets of FreeCAD. The word **module** refers to
any new group of tools, while **workbench** designates specifically a GUI
group of tools in the FreeCAD interface. All workbenches are defined in
modules, but not all modules contain a workbench. Practically, though, all the
main modules define a workbench with the same name, so the terms are almost
interchangeable.

Some of these modules are programmed in C++, others in Python, and some in a
mix of C++ and Python.
