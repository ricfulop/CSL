## Detailed Description

Enables scope handling for links This class is a base for all link properties
and enables them to handle scopes of the linked objects.

The possible scopes are defined by LinkScope enum class. The default value is
Local. The scope of a property is not saved in the document. It is a value
that needs to be fixed when the object holding the property is loaded. That is
possible with two methods:

  1. Set the scope value in the constructor of the link property
  2. Use setScope to change the scope in the constructor of the link property

The second option is only available in c++, not in python, as setscope is not
exposed. It would not make sense to expose it there, as restoring python
objects does not call the constructor again. Hence in python the only way to
create a LinkProperty with different scope than local is to use a specialized
property for that. In c++ existing properties can simply be changed via
setScope in the objects constructor.
