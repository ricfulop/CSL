C++ facilities to make it easier to write Python extensions.

CXX/Objects is a set of C++ facilities to make it easier to write Python
extensions. The chief way in which PyCXX makes it easier to write Python
extensions is that it greatly increases the probability that your program will
not make a reference-counting error and will not have to continually check
error returns from the Python C API. CXX/Objects integrates Python with C++ in
these ways:

C++ exception handling is relied on to detect errors and clean up. In a
complicated function this is often a tremendous problem when writing in C.
With PyCXX, we let the compiler keep track of what objects need to be
dereferenced when an error occurs. The Standard Template Library (STL) and its
many algorithms plug and play with Python containers such as lists and tuples.
The optional CXX/Extensions facility allows you to replace the clumsy C tables
with objects and method calls that define your modules and extension objects.

PyCXX documentation is split into [Python 3](http://cxx.sourceforge.net/PyCXX-
Python3.html) and [Python 2](http://cxx.sourceforge.net/PyCXX-Python2.html)
versions. The Python 3 documentation is the most accurate.
