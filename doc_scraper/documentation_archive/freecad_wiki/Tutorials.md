## Modeling parts

FreeCAD provides two main workflows to modeling parts:

  * combining objects, a method called [Constructive solid geometry](/Constructive_solid_geometry "Constructive solid geometry") (CSG) using the [Part Workbench](/Part_Workbench "Part Workbench"), and
  * using parametric modelling and [feature editing](/Feature_editing "Feature editing") with the [PartDesign Workbench](/PartDesign_Workbench "PartDesign Workbench").

Please note that the [PartDesign Workbench](/PartDesign_Workbench "PartDesign
Workbench") workflow was considerably changed from FreeCAD 0.17 onward; some
of the tutorials haven't been updated and may refer to the 0.16 version.
