FreeCAD started participating to the Google student coding program (GSoC) in
2016. We participated through a combined effort of many CAx projects, under
the BRL-CAD umbrella. Since 2023, we are applying as our own organization.

  * Main page of the program: <https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/>
  * Timeline: <https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline>
  * FreeCAD in GSoC 2025: To be announced

## How it works

  * The student writes a project proposal for FreeCAD, and uploads it the GSoC platform.
  * Students can choose to work on their own idea, or they can pick an idea suggested by the FreeCAD mentors team. There is no difference in how your project is reviewed or accepted, the important part is to work on something you like.
  * Proposals will be reviewed, evaluated, and ranked by FreeCAD mentors.
  * Google allocates a certain number of slots to each participating organization. Slots are allocated following the ranking order given by the project mentors.
  * If you are accepted, You will have two FreeCAD mentors assigned to you. there is a first period allocated to get to know FreeCAD, the community and your mentors, then the real coding period starts. Your work get reviewed at mid-term and at the end.

If you want to get involved, **study well the[GSoC Checklist](/GSoC_Checklist
"GSoC Checklist")**. Whether you're applying or accepted, we've itemized
everything you need to do in this list. We're here to help you become new open
source developers, so don't be shy if you have any questions.

## Writing your proposal

We are proposing a number of project ideas here. But you are in no way forced
to follow our ideas. You can propose anything you would like to work on, that
you thing would be an interesting project. Good places to hunt for ideas are
the [list of feature
requests](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AFeature),
the [FreeCAD forum](https://forum.freecad.org) or other FreeCAD communities,
like [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/FreeCAD),
[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/w2cTKGzccC) or
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/freecad).

You will find many templates and models on the internet, and on the [Google
Summer of Code website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), but it does not
need to be very elaborate. Again, what is important is that you choose a
subject you like. It's more important to get interested in your idea and do
some research about how you would achieve it than writing very long proposals.

What we expect to see in your proposal is what is explained on the [Google
Summer of Code website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). Additionally,
we want to see that you did your research, and that you explored FreeCAD
enough so we can trust you know what you are going into.

## The Selection Process

GSoC is about getting people involved and contributing to open source over the
long-term. As such, we heavily weight our application selection process
towards students that are interested in remaining involved in FreeCAD and open
source software development after GSoC has ended. GSoC is not a summer job,
although it happens during the Northern hemisphere summer months and requires
some dedication and commitment, like a job.

Additionally, submissions are ranked based on perception of the submitter's
abilities to complete the task within the program time frame, general
consensus on the technical approach being proposed, and overall interest in
having such modifications made to FreeCAD. Particular notice is made of
students that are responsive to questions and readily interactive with the
FreeCAD community, mainly through the [FreeCAD
forum](https://forum.freecad.org). Communication is a great thing. Having a
forum account already, and having already discussed your idea there, for
example under the [GSOC
section](https://forum.freecad.org/viewforum.php?f=46&sid=c47dc0459f8be0c52e072a8de66c8738),
is a great way to have people interested in your project.

Just about every GSoC organization receives considerably more project
proposals than can be accepted. Every application gets read multiple times and
reviewed in detail. Of those applications, only a small subset are selected so
keep in mind that the selection process is rather competitive.

Whether or not you are accepted, contributing to open source outside of GSoC
is one of the main goals of the program and is the best way to be noticed and
get your proposal accepted. Keep that in mind. Thanks for your interest and we
look forward to working with new FreeCAD developers!

And in case your proposal is not accepted but you would still like to work on
it, nothing prevents that! Several FreeCAD GSoC students in the past have
worked on their project outside the GSoC program.

## Possible Mentors

The pool of mentors will review all the proposals, each member will mark the
proposals they want to mentor, and each winning proposal will get the mentors
that marked their interest. There is no need for you to choose a mentor
yourself before starting. If you would like to get reviewing and mentorship
before starting, look for the mentors from previous years in the [GSoC section
of the FreeCAD forum](https://forum.freecad.org/viewforum.php?f=46), or simply
post something in that section to ask for review.

## Implementation Ideas

There are several sources for project ideas. The table below lists existing
project ideas already picked by the FreeCAD developers. FreeCAD also
previously participated in an umbrella organization for GSoC, and there are
[FreeCAD project ideas available in their GSoC
repo](https://github.com/opencax/GSoC/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+FreeCAD).
Additionally, there is a [forum
thread](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=84897) calling for
additional ideas which may be the basis of a project.

The ideas listed here or in the OpenCAx repo serve mostly as inspiration, and
do not have a higher chance of being accepted as project proposal. You are
totally free to build your own idea, specially for students with an
established involvement in FreeCAD who have already contributed code. Feel
free to contact us on the
[forum](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=84897) for further
discussions about the listed projects.

The size column shows the estimated time frame to complete the project, but
you are of course free to suggest otherwise if you see arguments for it.
Clicking on each idea will get you to its corresponding GitHub issue, which
will contain more details and where you can ask questions.
