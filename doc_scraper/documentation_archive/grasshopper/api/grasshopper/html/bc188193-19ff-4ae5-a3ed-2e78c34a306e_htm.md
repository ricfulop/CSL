# Assembly Hierarchy  
  
---  
  
  * Rhino Plug-in Architecture
  * DotNET Component Library
  * Assembly References

This document explains the hierarchy of all assemblies involved with the
**Grasshopper®** plug-in. This is important for component developers so they
know which Assembly References they need to have in order to compile a
_Grasshopper Component Library_. It also provides some background information
which is useful when communicating with other developers.

![](../icons/SectionExpanded.png)Rhino Plug-in Architecture

Grasshopper is a DotNET plug-in for Rhinoceros® 4.0 SR7 and later. It was
written using _Microsoft® Visual Studio® 2008 Professional_ using both
_VB.NET_ and _C#_ source compiled against the _DotNET 2.0 Framework_. It is
recommended, though not required, that you target the same framework when
developing Grasshopper Component Libraries.

Our aim is to keep Grasshopper dependencies as conservative as possible.
However, it is possible that we will switch to a higher version number of
Rhino or DotNET if this new version fixes crucial bugs or exposes useful
functions.

In order to inter-operate with the _Rhino C++ SDK_ , Grasshopper uses the
_RhinoCommon.dll_ wrapper SDK which is being developed for both Rhino5 and
RhinoMac. Grasshopper uses a special build of this SDK in order to run on
Rhino4.

![](../icons/SectionExpanded.png)DotNET Component Library

The Grasshopper project type is _Class Library_ , meaning it cannot be run as
a stand-alone application. Grasshopper.dll is loaded by a Rhino plugin called
GrasshopperPlugin.rhp. This was done so we could provide support for Rhino4
_and_ RhinoMac, without the need to resort to different builds of
Grasshopper.dll.

![](../icons/SectionExpanded.png)Assembly References

As a Class Library, Grasshopper references namespaces in addition to
RhinoCommon.dll, some of these are standard namespaces provided by the DotNET
Framework, others are 3rd party assemblies and others still are written by
McNeel developers but are shipped separately for technical reasons. Some of
these assemblies need to be referenced by Component developers, while others
can be safely ignored. The following table lists all assemblies referenced by
Grasshopper.dll:

Assembly| Author| Purpose| Required  
---|---|---|---  
RhinoCommon.dll| Robert McNeel & Associates| Rhinoceros 5.0 DotNET SDK|
![](../media/Dot_OK.png)  
GH_IO.dll| Robert McNeel & Associates| Grasshopper Input/Output library
required to read and write Grasshopper files.| ![](../media/Dot_OK.png)  
GH_Util.dll| Robert McNeel & Associates| Grasshopper utility library
containing some peripheral algorithms.| ![](../media/Dot_Error.png)  
QWhale.*.dll 1| Quantum Whale| Syntax highlighter functionality.|
![](../media/Dot_Error.png)  
System| Microsoft| Base DotNET Namespace.| ![](../media/Dot_OK.png)  
System.Drawing| Microsoft| DotNET namespace involved with drawing shapes and
text.| ![](../media/Dot_OK.png)  
System.Windows.Forms| Microsoft| DotNET namespace involved with dialogs and
controls.| ![](../media/Dot_OK.png)  
System.Collections.Generic| Microsoft| DotNET namespace containing useful list
classes.| ![](../media/Dot_OK.png)  
  
1 The QWhale product contains a total of 5 dlls.
