![](../icons/SectionExpanded.png)Properties

| Name| Description  
---|---|---  
![Public property](../icons/pubproperty.gif)|
[Duration](P_Grasshopper_GUI_GH_FadeAnimation_Duration.htm)|  Gets or sets the
duration (in milliseconds) for ZUI animations. Negative durations are not
allowed. The default is 350 milliseconds.  
![Public property](../icons/pubproperty.gif)|
[FadeAlpha](P_Grasshopper_GUI_GH_FadeAnimation_FadeAlpha.htm)|  Gets the blend
alpha byte for the current state. 0 means fully hidden, 255 means fully shown.  
![Public property](../icons/pubproperty.gif)|
[FadeFactor](P_Grasshopper_GUI_GH_FadeAnimation_FadeFactor.htm)|  Gets the
blend factor for the current state. 0.0 means fully hidden, 1.0 means fully
shown.  
![Public property](../icons/pubproperty.gif)|
[IsFinished](P_Grasshopper_GUI_GH_FadeAnimation_IsFinished.htm)|  Gets a value
indicating whether this animator has finished animating.  
![Public property](../icons/pubproperty.gif)|
[Phase](P_Grasshopper_GUI_GH_FadeAnimation_Phase.htm)|  Gets the current
animation phase.  
![Public property](../icons/pubproperty.gif)|
[Threshold](P_Grasshopper_GUI_GH_FadeAnimation_Threshold.htm)|  Gets or sets
the threshold value for the fade animation trigger.  
![Public property](../icons/pubproperty.gif)|

![](../icons/SectionExpanded.png)Methods

| Name| Description  
---|---|---  
![Public method](../icons/pubmethod.gif)|
[Evaluate(GH_Canvas)](M_Grasshopper_GUI_GH_FadeAnimation_Evaluate.htm)|
Reevaluate the fade animation parameters. You should call this method from
within the Render method of your attributes. If an animation is currently in
progress a redraw of the canvas will be scheduled, whether or not the
attributes are actually visible on the canvas. You should therefore only call
this method if your attributes are already drawing themselves.  
![Public method](../icons/pubmethod.gif)| [Evaluate(GH_Canvas,
Boolean)](M_Grasshopper_GUI_GH_FadeAnimation_Evaluate_1.htm)|  Reevaluate the
fade animation parameters. You should call this method from within the Render
method of your attributes. If an animation is currently in progress a redraw
of the canvas will be scheduled, whether or not the attributes are actually
visible on the canvas. You should therefore only call this method if your
attributes are already drawing themselves.  
![Public method](../icons/pubmethod.gif)| [Evaluate(GH_Canvas,
Single)](M_Grasshopper_GUI_GH_FadeAnimation_Evaluate_2.htm)|  Reevaluate the
fade animation parameters. You should call this method from within the Render
method of your attributes. If an animation is currently in progress a redraw
of the canvas will be scheduled, whether or not the attributes are actually
visible on the canvas. You should therefore only call this method if your
attributes are already drawing themselves.  
![Public method](../icons/pubmethod.gif)| [Evaluate(GH_Canvas, Single,
Boolean)](M_Grasshopper_GUI_GH_FadeAnimation_Evaluate_3.htm)|  Reevaluate the
fade animation parameters. You should call this method from within the Render
method of your attributes. If an animation is currently in progress a redraw
of the canvas will be scheduled, whether or not the attributes are actually
visible on the canvas. You should therefore only call this method if your
attributes are already drawing themselves.
