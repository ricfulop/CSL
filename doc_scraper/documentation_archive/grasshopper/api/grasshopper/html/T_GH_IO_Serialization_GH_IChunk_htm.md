| Name| Description  
---|---|---  
![Public property](../icons/pubproperty.gif)|
[Archive](P_GH_IO_Serialization_GH_IChunk_Archive.htm)|  Gets a pointer to the

![Public property](../icons/pubproperty.gif)|
[ArchiveLocation](P_GH_IO_Serialization_GH_IChunk_ArchiveLocation.htm)|  Gets
a string representing the URI with which the archive is associated. The
location may be a null string.  
![Public property](../icons/pubproperty.gif)|
[ChunkCount](P_GH_IO_Serialization_GH_IChunk_ChunkCount.htm)|  Gets the number
