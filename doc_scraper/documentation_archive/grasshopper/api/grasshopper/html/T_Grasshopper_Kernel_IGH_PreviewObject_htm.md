the boundingboxes of all the geometry that is drawn by this object.  
![Public property](../icons/pubproperty.gif)|
[Hidden](P_Grasshopper_Kernel_IGH_PreviewObject_Hidden.htm)|  Gets or sets a
value indicating whether or not this object is currently drawing preview
flags.  
![Public property](../icons/pubproperty.gif)|
[IsPreviewCapable](P_Grasshopper_Kernel_IGH_PreviewObject_IsPreviewCapable.htm)|
Gets a value indicating whether or not this object (in its current state) can
draw geometric previews at all.
