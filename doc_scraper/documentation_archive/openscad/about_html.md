# About OpenSCAD

OpenSCAD is software for creating solid 3D CAD models. It is free software and
available for Linux/UNIX, Windows and Mac OS X. Unlike most free software for
creating 3D models (such as Blender) it does not focus on the artistic aspects
of 3D modelling but instead on the CAD aspects. Thus it might be the
application you are looking for when you are planning to create 3D models of
machine parts but pretty sure is not what you are looking for when you are
more interested in creating computer-animated movies.

OpenSCAD is not an interactive modeller. Instead it is something like a
3D-compiler that reads in a script file that describes the object and renders
the 3D model from this script file. This gives you (the designer) full control
over the modelling process and enables you to easily change any step in the
modelling process or make designs that are defined by configurable parameters.

OpenSCAD provides two main modelling techniques: First there is constructive
solid geometry (aka CSG) and second there is extrusion of 2D outlines. Autocad
DXF files can be used as the data exchange format for such 2D outlines. In
addition to 2D paths for extrusion it is also possible to read design
parameters from DXF files. Besides DXF files OpenSCAD can read and create 3D
models in the STL and OFF file formats.

# Underlying Technology

OpenSCAD builds on top of a number of free software libraries; is uses
[Qt](http://qt-project.org) for user interface, [CGAL](http://cgal.org) for
CSG evaluation, [OpenCSG](http://opencsg.org) and OpenGL for CSG previews, as
well as boost, eigen and glew.
