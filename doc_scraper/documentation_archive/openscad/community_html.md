The Matrix room got disconnected due to issues with the bridge [Deportalling
from Libera.Chat](https://matrix.org/blog/2023/07/deportalling-libera-chat/).
Unfortunately there is no solution yet for reconnecting the existing room, a
ticket with Matrix support is so far unanswered. If you can help fixing this
issue, please reach out.
