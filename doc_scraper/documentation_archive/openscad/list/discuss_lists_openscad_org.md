List Summary

OpenSCAD general discussion Mailing-list

The OpenSCAD Mailing-list is a place to discuss usage, problems and
development topics related to OpenSCAD.

If you wish to join the discussion you can either send an email to [discuss-
join@lists.openscad.org](mailto:discuss-join@lists.openscad.org) (no subject
or content required)  
or manually, see below under Membership.

You will receive a confirmation email which you MUST reply to, check your spam
folders.  
Once confirmed an Administrator will need to accept your subscription, this
can take some time.

The Mailing-list Archive has a Web front-end at
<https://lists.openscad.org/empathy/list/discuss.lists.openscad.org> which is
provided by the list hosting company,  
but it's not a Forum and has a number of bugs & it is not recommended.
Particularly not for Posting New Threads.  
It may be useful for searches, but topics displayed are badly formatted.  
Of note it can 'format' .scad code, introducing errors.

NOTE: The old Nabble hosted Web based Forum no longer exists.
