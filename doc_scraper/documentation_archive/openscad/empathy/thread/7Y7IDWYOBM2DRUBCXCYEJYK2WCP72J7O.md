###  Should lambda functions be found in use<d> files?

xlib.scad:

x=function () "from_xlib";

my source file:

use<xlib.scad>  
echo(x());

WARNING: Ignoring unknown function 'x' in file test.scad, line 2

ECHO: undef

I think this is a bug, as variables from use files are available and  
functions are as well, so shouldn't variables which are lambda functions?

Ugh I'm always confused because bosl2 uses include and we're discussing why
more-or-less in the other threads. Thanks.

Yes, includes allow you to reference variables. Use does not.
