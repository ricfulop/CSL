I use the alt- left & alt-right arrow combination quite a lot, and have been
wondering why alt-right arrow adds extra digits if needed, but alt-left arrow
does not?  
I often find I need to add another digit on the left (10's, 100's etc) and it
would be good (for me anyway) to have both left & right adding the extra
digit(s).

Am I missing something, or is that just the way it is?

A baby can be defined as an ego with a noise at one end and a smell at the
other.  
Your job as parents is to teach them to control all three.  
My job as a grandad is to tell you how you are doing it all wrong!
