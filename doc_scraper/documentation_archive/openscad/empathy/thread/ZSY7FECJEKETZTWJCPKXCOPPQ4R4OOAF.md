Is there a clean way to set up a projection(cut=var) such that var can be  
set in the interface, and if it is not set, then extrude the part to some  
thickness without duplicating the call inside an if/then/else?

pseudo code:

    
    
    if (projection_cut) {
        projection(cut = true)
           part1(var1, ... );
    } else {
        linear_extrude(thickness2)
             part1(var1, ... );
    }
    

I've tried a number of things and get various complaints like:

    
    
        projection(cut = projection_cut)
        linear_extrude(thickness2)
           part1(var1, ... );
    

and

    
    
        linear_extrude(thickness2)
        projection(cut = projection_cut)
           part1(var1, ... );
    

And similar variants.

Anyway, I am hoping to clean up some code.

I need to modify my description above (I misunderstood what the  
projection(cut) was doing). Basically under normal conditions I want the  
part to 3D render, but if I set a cut variable, I wanted it projected into  
2D to process as a laser cut file. I was hoping there was a trick to keep  
from duplicating the calls.

maybeCut() sphere(r=20);

Similarly if you really meant project rather than cut.

module maybeCut() { if (shouldCut) { projection(cut=true) children(); } else {
children(); } } maybeCut() sphere(r=20); Similarly if you really meant project
