With Marius's blessing, I've restored most or all of the documentation  
to its state before the recent series of over-enthusiastic updates.

Although I was pretty methodical, and checked the entire cheat sheet  
(the development snapshot version), it is certainly possible that I  
missed something.

I only inspected the top-level page and everything linked from it. If  
there's a third-level page, I would have missed it. Let me know.

I am sure that there is a lot of baby in that bathwater. If something  
is unclear or incorrect, let me know and we can work to fix it.

If you see any other issue ... let me know.

I should note that I reverted away _all_ of the changes starting with  
those updates. I did not attempt to review intermediate updates by  
other people; I assumed that they were correcting errors in that series  
of updates and so were no longer necessary. If there were substantive  
updates in there that need to be un-reverted... let me know.

There was a command or function "isset" mentioned in a recent thread  
that I still do not see in the cheat sheet. Used in the context of  
var[3] to added a 4th element to an 3 element array passed by name. Was  
that a typu?

Unrelated, I also had a segfault exit that caused me to have to rewrite  
2 modules earlier this morning, I hadn't saved recently enough. No  
keyboard activity had been done in the preceding 10 seconds. This from:  
OpenSCAD <https://www.openscad.org/>version 2025.04.28.ai25192 (git  
535d96fe2) as I haven't updated since this latest argument started.

Thanks all, for some really great software.

I don't think OpenSCAD has sets so why would there be an inset?

There was a command or function "isset" mentioned in a recent thread that I
still do not see in the cheat sheet. Used in the context of var[3] to added a
4th element to an 3 element array passed by name. Was that a typu?

It doesn’t exist. I think it was a hypothetical function that checked to see
if a value was set. Perhaps it should really have been is_undef().

____

Unrelated, I also had a segfault exit …

File an issue, please.

File an issue, please. If I could find a log entry, but dmesg is clean except
for cups refreshing its printer list.

The window OpenSCAD was running in said this:

But I've no clue where that core dump is... Nor have I rebooted, I just  
restarted OpenSCAD and reinvented those 2 wheels, and have added about  
60 some more LOC since w/o further problems.

Makes sense. Thanks Jordan. I did have a problem with an if() earlier  
today, setting a var from the true/false of that was a showstopper error  
so since I needed a yes or no, I wound up multiplying the passed in  
value, the product of which if (k) was 0 or the multiplier if 1 was  
passed in. Worked exactly as I needed.. That did work as advertised on  
the cheat sheet a couple months back. And it works as expected about 10  
other places in this current projects src file. It is all the stuff  
for a miniature paper cutter, used to make the paper wrapped cartridges  
used during our civil war in the 1860's.
