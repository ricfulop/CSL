Can some of you please download and check if this file f6 renders. This is  
a bit heavy 4mb file:

It could be using too much memory - could you try slimming down the model a
bit and see if you can get a smaller version to work?

I tested the model on my work-computer while I was at home. I gave up  
watching the screen not-change, but when I arrived at work maybe 24h  
later it was rendered!

Anyway, the output in the openscad window is:

Parsing design (AST generation)...  
Compiling design (CSG Tree generation)...  
Rendering Polygon Mesh using Manifold...  
ERROR: [manifold] Input mesh is not closed!  
ERROR: [manifold] Surface_mesh -> Manifold conversion failed: NotManifold  
ERROR: [manifold] Input mesh is not closed!  
ERROR: [manifold] Surface_mesh -> Manifold conversion failed: NotManifold

CGAL Polyhedrons in cache: 0  
CGAL cache size in bytes: 0  
Total rendering time: 0:00:02.674  
Top level object is a 3D object:  
Facets: 68578  
Rendering finished.

So... 3 things:

  * Manifold thinks it is not manifold.
  * the render time is not recorded accurately. I didn't give   
up /that/ fast.

I have just re-run my test and this time it previewed taking 10:45  
(645 seconds) to preview and then render (F6) in... lets take  
openscad's word for it, under 3 seconds. Openscad recorded 1 second  
and 24 milliseconds of "render time" for the preview. That is about  
99.7% wrong.

Manifold warns, cgal just fails and returns "no geometry".

So "completely no results" is consistent with CGAL F6 render.

Would exporting the manifold output result in a broken STL that might  
be fixable? Or maybe help in finding where the original fails to be  
manifold?

IMHO, CGAL was the cause of some meshes ending up non-manifold.  
Switching to Manifold has helped a lot.

    
    
    Roger.

It does not render here.  
OpenSCAD <https://www.openscad.org/> version 2025.07.15.snap,  
RockyLinux 9.6, 2011 MacBook Pro w/16G RAM

The preview comes up almost immediately. Render hangs at 19/1000. One  
CPU is pegged at 100%.

Finally f6 render works and I think this could be a generic solution to the  
filleting problem, with some higher resolution (with python support  
obviously)  
Attached is the file, would request some of you to please check if f6  
render works. Also the file size is much smaller now

Thanks Michael  
That means it does render after a long time but practically unusable

I tested the model on my work-computer while I was at home. I gave up  
watching the screen not-change, but when I arrived at work maybe 24h  
later it was rendered!

Anyway, the output in the openscad window is:

Compiling design (CSG Tree generation)...  
Rendering Polygon Mesh using Manifold...  
ERROR: [manifold] Input mesh is not closed!  
ERROR: [manifold] Surface_mesh -> Manifold conversion failed: NotManifold

Rendering finished.

So... 3 things:

  * Manifold thinks it is not manifold.
  * the render time is not recorded accurately. I didn't give   
up /that/ fast.

I have just re-run my test and this time it previewed taking 10:45

So "completely no results" is consistent with CGAL F6 render.
