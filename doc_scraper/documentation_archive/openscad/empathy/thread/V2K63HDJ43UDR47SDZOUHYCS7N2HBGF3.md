I recently installed the 2025.09.02 Nightly Build, but it seems to lock up
every time I try to open any of my previously working models. I tried
uninstalling & reinstalling it, but no difference. I could not find anywhere
to download any of the previous nightly builds, is there anywhere I can get
them? Thanks.

No guarantees, but usually you can find previous releases at
<https://files.openscad.org/snapshots/>

I see you already have an answer, but here's what I do:

I use a Linux Appimage, and When I download a new nightly, before I  
install it, I rename the one I was using and install the new one.  
If you are running Windows, you can do something similar by keeping the  
install file and renaming it before downloading the new one.
