Essential Mathematics for Computational Design

Introduces to design professionals the foundation mathematical concepts for
effective development of computational 3D models.

_Essential Mathematics for Computational Design_ introduces to design
professionals the foundation mathematical concepts that are necessary for
effective development of computational methods for 3D modeling and computer
graphics. This is not meant to be a complete and comprehensive resource, but
rather an overview of the basic and most commonly used concepts. The material
is directed towards designers who have little or no background in mathematics
beyond high school. All concepts are explained visually using [Grasshopper®
(GH)](https://www.grasshopper3d.com), the generative modeling environment for
[Rhinoceros® (Rhino)](https://www.rhino3d.com).

The content is divided into three chapters. [Chapter
1](https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/general/essential-mathematics/vector-
mathematics/) discusses vector math including vector representation, vector
operation, and line and plane equations. [Chapter
2](https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/general/essential-
mathematics/matrices-transformations/) reviews matrix operations and
transformations. [Chapter
3](https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/general/essential-
mathematics/parametric-curves-surfaces/) includes an in-depth review of
parametric curves with special focus on NURBS curves and the concepts of
continuity and curvature. It also reviews NURBS surfaces and polysurfaces.

_I would like to acknowledge the excellent and thorough technical review
by[Dr. Dale Lear](https://discourse.mcneel.com/u/dalelear/activity) of Robert
McNeel & Associates. His valuable comments were instrumental in producing this
edition. I would also like to acknowledge Ms. [Margaret
Becker](https://discourse.mcneel.com/u/margaret/activity) of Robert McNeel &
Associates for reviewing the technical writing and formatting_.
