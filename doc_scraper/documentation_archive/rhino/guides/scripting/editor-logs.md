## Opening Log Viewer

_Script Editor_ writes log messages during its operation. These log messages
are useful in detecting any internal errors that might have happened when
working with the script editor. You can view these logs by clicking on the
_Open Logger_ button on the far right side of editor status bar, or by running
**RhinoCodeLogs** command:

The same button is also available on a few other editor dialogs like _Publish
Project_ dialog:

This opens the **RhinoCode Logs** window:

## Saving Logs

To save all the log messages into a file, choose _Logs > Save Contents_ menu
item and save the logs to disk. By default the contents are saved to a log
file named `ScriptEditor.log`
