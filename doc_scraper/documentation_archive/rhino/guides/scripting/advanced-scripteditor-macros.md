ScriptEditor Command in Macros

## ScriptEditor Command Options

_ScriptEditor_ command has a few options that could be used in macros. Run
`_-ScriptEditor` command in Rhino prompt to see these options (`-` is for non-
interactive mode, and `_` ensures command works in all Rhino UI languages.
[See Command Macros & Scripting](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/8/help/en-
us/information/rhinoscripting.htm) for more):

  * **Edit (E):** This is the default option when running ScriptEditor command in Rhino. It opens the standalone Script Editor and initialized all languages.

  * **Run (R):** Runs given script using the new scripting infrastructure in Rhino 8. It can run scripts or script files of any supported language.

    * **Browse (B):** Using this suboption, allows to browse and select a script file
    * Run a script file in a macro this way ðŸ‘‰ `_-ScriptEditor _R "C:\path\to\script.py"`
    * Run a script in a macro this way ðŸ‘‡. Note that the language specifier (`#! python 3`, `#! python 2`, or `// #! csharp`) is necessary so the command can determine which language to run the script with:

    
    
    _-ScriptEditor _R (
        #! python 3
        print("Hello Rhino")
    )
    

  * **Open (O):** : Opens given script file in ScriptEditor 
    * **Browse (B):** Using this suboption, allows to browse and open a script file
    * Open a script file to edit this way ðŸ‘‰ `_-ScriptEditor _O "C:\path\to\script.py"`

## Script Search Paths

Normally you have specify the full script path in a macro like `_-ScriptEditor
_R "C:\path\to\HelloWorld.py"` to run the script. However, you can place your
most common scripts under a directory, and add the path of that directory to
[Rhino File Search Paths](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/8/help/en-
us/options/files_search_paths.htm). When search paths are set up, you can run
`_-ScriptEditor _R "HelloWorld.py"` and the command can find the script under
specified search paths.

Please note that [Python Module Search
Paths](https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/scripting/editor-configs/#python-
paths) are not searched for scripts. They are purely to search and find python
modules.
