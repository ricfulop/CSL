Creating a Rhino Plug-In Package

by [Will Pearson](https://discourse.mcneel.com/u/will/) (Last updated:
Thursday, February 4, 2021)

The [Package Manager](https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/yak/) was
introduced in Rhino 7. It makes it easier to discover, install and manage
Rhino plug-ins from within Rhino. This guide will describe how to create a
package from a Rhino plug-in that can be published to the package server.

__Note __

The package manager is cross-platform. The examples below are for Windows. For
Mac, replace the path to the Yak CLI tool with `"/Applications/Rhino
8.app/Contents/Resources/bin/yak"`.

First, let‚Äôs assume you have a folder on your computer which contains all the
files that you would like to distribute in your package. Something like this‚Ä¶

    
    
    C:\Users\Bozo\dist
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Tamarin.rhp
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon.png
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ misc\
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE.txt
    

__Note __

This is just an example. The only files that matter are Tamarin.rhp and
icon.png (we‚Äôll reference the icon in the manifest.yml file later).

We‚Äôre going to use the Yak CLI tool to create the package, so open up a
Command Prompt and navigate to the directory above.

    
    
    > cd C:\Users\Bozo\dist
    

Now, we need a `manifest.yml` file! You can easily create your own by studying
the [Manifest Reference Guide](../the-package-manifest). Alternatively, you
can use the `spec` command to generate a skeleton file. We‚Äôll do the latter
here.

    
    
    > "C:\Program Files\Rhino 8\System\Yak.exe" spec
    
    Inspecting content: Tamarin.rhp
    
    ---
    name: tamarin
    version: 1.0.0
    authors:
    - Park Ranger
    description: An example RhinoCommon plug-in
    url: https://example.com
    
    
    Saved to C:\Users\Bozo\dist\manifest.yml
    

The `spec` command takes a look at the current directory and, if present, will
glean useful information from the `.rhp` assembly and use it generate a
`manifest.yml` with name, version, description etc. pre-populated. If you
haven‚Äôt added this information, then placeholders will be used.

The RhinoCommon plug-in inspector extracts the assembly attributes that you
set when creating your plug-in. The `AssemblyInformationalVersion` attribute
is used to populate the version field, since this attribute isn‚Äôt bound to the
Microsoft four-digit version spec and can contain a SemVer-compatible version
string. The `AssemblyVersion` attribute is used as a fallback.

__Note __

The `spec` command is useful for generating the manifest.yml file initially.
Once you have one, keep it with your project and update it for each release.

Next, open the manifest file with your [favourite
editor](https://code.visualstudio.com) and fill in the gaps.

Afterwards, you should have something that looks a little like this‚Ä¶

    name: tamarin
    version: 1.0.0
    authors:
    - Park Ranger
    description: >
      This plug-in does something. I'm not really sure exactly what it's supposed to
      do, but it does it better than any other plug-in.  
    url: https://example.com
    icon: icon.png
    keywords:
    - something
    

Now that we have a manifest file, we can build the package!

    
    
    > "C:\Program Files\Rhino 8\System\Yak.exe" build
    
    Building package from contents of C:\Users\Bozo\dist
    
    Found manifest.yml for package: tamarin (1.0.0)
    Inspecting content: Tamarin.rhp
    Creating tamarin-1.0.0-rh6_18-any.yak

    name: tamarin
    version: 1.0.0

    - Will Pearson
    description: >
      This plug-in does something. I'm not really sure exactly what it's supposed to
      do, but it does it better than any other plug-in.
    url: https://example.com
    keywords:
    - something
    - guid:c9beedb9-07ec-4974-a0a2-44670ddb17e4
    
    C:\Users\Bozo\dist\tamarin-1.0.0-rh6_18-any.yak
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Tamarin.dll
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Tamarin.rhp
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.yml
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ misc/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE.txt
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
    

__Note __

The filename includes a [‚Äúdistribution tag‚Äù](../the-anatomy-of-a-
package#distributions) (in this case `rh6_18-any`). The first part, `rh6_18`,
is inferred from the version of Rhinocommon.dll or Rhino C++ SDK that is
referenced in the plug-in project. The second part, `any`, refers to the
platform that the plug-in is intended for. To build a platform-specfic
package, run the `build` command again with the `--platform <platform>`
argument, where `<platform>` can be either `win` or `mac`.

__Warning __

Currently, if you publish a package with a `rh6*` distribution tag, it will
not be installable for Rhino 7. If your plug-in also works in Rhino 7, please
mark it as compatible by copying the .yak file, updating the distribution tag
part of the filename (i.e. `rh6_18` ‚û° `rh7_0`) and [pushing both to the
package server](../pushing-a-package-to-the-server).

__Note __

You might notice your plug-in‚Äôs GUID lurking in the keywords. More information
on how this is used can be found in the [‚ÄúPackage Restore in
Grasshopper‚Äù](../package-restore-in-grasshopper) guide.

Congratulations! üôå You‚Äôve just created a package for your Rhino plug-in.

## Next Steps

Now that you‚Äôve created a package, [push it to the package server](../pushing-
a-package-to-the-server) to make it available in the package manager!
