Register as an Issuer in Cloud Zoo

by [Andrés Jacobo (AJ) González](https://discourse.mcneel.com/u/aj1/) and
[Will Pearson](https://discourse.mcneel.com/u/will/) (Last updated: Thursday,

In Cloud Zoo, an _issuer_ represents a vendor of products with license keys.
If you want your plugin to use Cloud Zoo, you must register to be an issuer by
emailing [support@mcneel.com](mailto:support@mcneel.com) with the subject
_“Cloud Zoo issuer registration for NAME”_ (replace _NAME_ with your name*) or
clicking on the link below.

  
[Send us a registration
email](mailto:support@mcneel.com?subject=Cloud%20Zoo%20issuer%20registration%20for%20NAME&body=Please%20register%20a%20new%20Cloud%20Zoo%20issuer%20for%20%27NAME%27%20to%20use%20with%20the%20following%20plug-
in%28s%29:%20...)  
  

* _Please provide the name (organization or individual) that you would like the issuer to be registered under, e.g. “Acme Inc” or “Jolyn Bloggs”._

You will be provided with an issuer id and a secret that will uniquely
identify you as a product vendor and will allow you to implement the required
HTTPS callbacks.
