__

by [Dan Rigdon-Bel](https://discourse.mcneel.com/u/dan/) and [Callum
Sykes](https://discourse.mcneel.com/u/Callumsykes/) (Last updated: Monday,

By the end of this guide, you should have all the tools installed necessary
for authoring, building, and debugging C# .NET plugins using RhinoCommon in
Rhino for Mac.

## Prerequisites

This guide presumes you have an:

  * [Apple Mac](http://store.apple.com/) running [macOS](https://www.apple.com/osx/) Monterey (12) or later.
  * [Rhino for Mac](https://www.rhino3d.com/download/)

## Install Visual Studio Code

__What happened to Visual Studio for Mac?__

Visual Studio for Mac has been [retired by
Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/mac/what-happened-
to-vs-for-mac?view=vsmac-2022).

#### Step-by-Step

  1. _[Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)_.
  2. Once you have downloaded the _VSCode-darwin-universal.zip_ , double-click it to unzip.
  3. Drag Visual Studio Code to the _/Applications_ folder.
  4. Open Visual Studio Code, you will need to click “Open” the first time you open it.
  5. You will need to install some packages before starting, luckily all the required pacakges are bundled together. These can be found by clicking “Extensions” on the left side bar: 
     * [Intellicode for C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.vscodeintellicode-csharp)
     * [NuGet Gallery Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=patcx.vscode-nuget-gallery) (_Recommended_)
  6. Restart Visual Studio Code.
  7. Visual Studio Code is installed in your _/Applications_ folder. You will want to _drag its icon to your Dock_ for future use or - if it’s running - right/option-click the icon in the Dock and select _Keep in Dock_.

## Next Steps
